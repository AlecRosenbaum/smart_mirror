Design Considerations:


-Cost

The hardware used for this project needs to be under the $400 budget set by the Senior Design Instructor. 


-Hardware Limitations

The product shall perform processing of gestures onboard in order to help keep network interaction to a minimum and avoid the need for remote processing overhead. The Mirror shall operate using an LCD panel which is sized 21” diagonal. 


-Hardware Specifications

The interactive mirror shall share sizing with the LCD panel on which it is mounted, this allows for a cleaner design as well as a closer physical realization of screen size. The mirrored component will be affixed to the front of this panel with another medium separating the physical panel and reflective coating. 


-Software Environment

The interactive mirror will be developed to run on a linux-based operating system and will extensively use Google’s Chrome browser. The gesture control shall be performed using a Leap Motion motion sensor, and a proprietary API our team will create.

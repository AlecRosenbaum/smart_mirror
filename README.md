# Interactive Smart Mirror
Interactive Smart Mirror - Senior Design Project

### Team:

# Design Considerations:

## Software

* The OS will be linux-based (currently testing on ubuntu, but may move to a lighter-weight alternative)
* We will use Google Chrome (or Chromium) with a custom extension to drive the display
* We will write an application utilizing the Leap Motion API for gesture control

## Hardware

* The hardware used for this project needs to be under the $400 budget set by the Senior Design Instructor.
* Processing will be done onboard to keep network traffic low, and to eliminate remote processing overhead and complexity
* We have a 21" LCD and 60GB SSD, so those will be used for the display and storage
* The mirror will be bezel-less, but the mirror diagonal will be larger than the LCD by a few inches
* We will use the Leap Motion sensor as input for hand-tracking

## Gesture Interaction Design

There will be two primary forms of gesture interaction: One Finger and Two Fingers.

### One Finger
### Two Fingers

## Pittsburgh Port Authority API for Node

Node library for making API calls to the Pittsburgh Port Authority
Bus Tracking (PAT) service. Please consult the Port Authority developer
documentation for method parameters and response tags. All responses are JavaScript objects. 
You will need a developer API key from the Port Authority to use this library

```javascript
var patapi = require('patapi')('your-api-key')
patapi.getVehicles({rt: '28X'}, function (err, buses) {
  if (!err) {
    var buslist = buses['vehicle']
    for (var i = 0; i < buslist.length; i++) {
      console.log(buslist[i])
    }
  }
})
```

Consult the tests in ```test.js``` for some example usage. Running the tests may
take time, as the tests contact the PAT server...

```
npm test
```

### TODO

- Get appropriate data types for response object fields. Currently, all response
fields are strings. Lat/Lon should be floats, and heading should be an integer.
